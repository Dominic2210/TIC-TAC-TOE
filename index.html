        <li>The goal of the game is to be the first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of their symbols (X or O) on the 3x3 grid.</li>
         <h3>RULES :</h3>
          <li>Decide which player will be X and which will be O.</li>
          <li>Players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) on an empty spot on the grid.</li>
          <li>The first player (X) makes the initial move.</li>
          <li>A player wins by having three of their symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</li>
          <li>If the entire grid is filled without a winner, the game is a draw.</li>
          <li>Players must make a move during their turn; no skipping turns is allowed.</li>
          <li>Once a player makes a move, it cannot be changed.</li>
          <li>Players cannot place their symbol on a position that is already occupied by their opponent's symbol or their own.</li>
          <li>The game ends when a player wins or when all positions on the grid are filled (resulting in a draw).</li>
          <li>If a player achieves three in a row, their victory is announced, and the game concludes.</li>
          <li>After the game ends, players can choose to play again or reset the grid for a new match.</li>
          <li>Sportsmanship is encouraged, and players should congratulate the winner or acknowledge a draw.</li>
